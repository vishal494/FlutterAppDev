# bmi_calc

A new Flutter application.
This my first flutter application, inspired by Angela Yu's tutorial.

This app calculates the BMI or a person based on gender.
The gender selector are tapable field and the height is a scrollable field and weight increases by tapping the (+) or (-) buttons which are flat buttons and similarly the age selector.!
